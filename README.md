# hungarian-method-web-app

This app is a real implementation of Hungaria algorithm in php.
The core code of this app is based on https://github.com/rpfk/Hungarian.

Note : Since I was not include some of the dist files, such as Bootstrap and Fontawesome, you may find the interface or frontend doesn't work really well.
